#### Our workflow

At first we divided the missions between us and updated it in the Jira. <br>
Then, we started to arrange our project to build as MVVM architecture. <br>
Afterwards, we started doing the most basic interactions with the server - to add a profile, to sign in and create a token to see it all works. <br>
Then, we divided our work for the users, posts and friends and end up merging all toghter. <br>
During our work we checked after every little detail we changed that our app behavior is as we expected. <br> 
When everything worked as we expected we upload our program. <br>
